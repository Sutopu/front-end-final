Description: The purpose of this assignment is to create a website using everything we have learned about web
design, HTML, CSS, and any other technologies that we have come across.

Technologies list:
nvm (Node Version Manager)
npm (Node Package Manager)
React (front-end Javascript web framework)
Bootstrap (css framework)

to run development server:
npm start


notes:
currently i'm pretty sure that I'm not using bootstrap correctly with React. It seems like there is a package to
install with npm. currently I just link it in index.html
